My code is able to read a text file, using a BufferedReader, to render a 3D image made of
3 sided polygons(triangles). Each line of the text file gives me 3 points which are the vectors
of the polygon. It finds which polygons are visible or normal (z-value is -) and calculates the
shading of the polygons using RGB values which are included with the text files. I then render
the image calculating an edgelist and a z-buffer. The edgelist gives me the mins and maxs of the
polygons while the z-buffer checks to see which pixels are in front of others using a depth.

The program is supposed to be able to rotate a 3D image but mine doesn't quite work correctly.
I can't figure out why as all my test cases seem to pass fine so it must be something wrong in
another part of the code that isn't directly to do with my rotation methods. To test my code worked
correctly I really utilised to JUnit tests given to me they really helped to figure out when I had
completed a method as opposed to finding out at the very end. Printing out my arraylists was also
very helpful because I encountered a bug where some of my polygons were missing and I was able to
find out I was missing every 2nd line because I was using a readLine() one to many times.

I also wasn't able to figure out how the colour sliders worked but the image at the very least
does render the correct colours.
